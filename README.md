# So you forgot your supercomputer

Rather than use a slide deck for my lightning talk in Archer Champions in April 2018, I just used a bunch of links.  Here are the links that made up my 'slides'

* http://rse.shef.ac.uk/ (RSE Sheffield - Where I was when all this happened)
* https://www.nag.co.uk/ (NAG came to teach us MPI)
* http://mikecroucher.github.io/MLPM_talk/ (But croucher's law meant that I forgot my supercomputer)
* https://alces-flight.com/ (Alces Flight + Amazon EC2)
* http://www.walkingrandomly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/alces_flight_login.png (It looks like a traditional HPC system)
* http://alces-software.com/we/make/alces-gridware/ (Lots of standard modules are pre-built)
* http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=6392 (The cluster cost less than the coffee and I had up to 128 cores)
* https://github.com/mikecroucher/Jupyter-Matrix-Matrix/blob/master/results/c4.4xlarge.ipynb (Each node is ~2x as powerful as a MacbookPro)
* https://github.com/mikecroucher/Jupyter-Matrix-Matrix/blob/master/results/MacBookPro2014.ipynb 
* http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=6431 (Details of how I customised it)
* https://github.com/mikecroucher/alces_flight_customisation (The GitHub repo I used for customisation scripts)
* https://medium.com/@alcesflight/desperately-seeking-supercomputer-bdf72a10f1a8 (Alces Flight wrote about it too)
